# GOManim

A collection of manimations (manim animations) created using ManimCE (Mathematical Animation Engine Community Edition).

## Overview

This project contains various examples to learn ManimCE and its capabilities. This project allows **ANYONE** in this world to learn and create animations(basic, advanced, complex **ANYTHING**) using ManimCE.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+ [3.10+ recommended]
- Manim
- Cairo
- FFmpeg
- LaTeX distribution (like TeX Live or MiKTeX) for rendering LaTeX equations [OPTIONAL]

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TechySC23/manimations.git
```

```markdown:README.md
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install manim
```

___

### Recommendation

Use the  ```uv``` to install the manimce, and its good because its faster than any other package manager like ```pip```.

## Usage

To render an animation, use:

```bash
manim -pql scene_file.py SceneName
```

----

### Render Flags

- `-p`: Preview the animation
- `-q`: No progress bar
- `-l`: low quality (-h for high quality, will take more time to render)

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-animation`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add amazing animation'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-animation`)

## Extra things

Ever wanted to learn Front End Development, but struggled with it?

Check Out My other Repository, [**LocalRepo**](https://github.com/TechySC23/LocalRepo), A end to end solution for learning front end development and tips and tricks for it.

It is still work in progress, but it is a good resource to learn front end development. If anybody can help me in maintaining the repository as well, Feel Free to contact me at - [**TechySC23**](https://github.com/TechySC23)
